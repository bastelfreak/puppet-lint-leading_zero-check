A puppet-lint plugin to check for unquoted numbers with leading zero.


## Checks

### Unquoted number with leading zero

In the future parser numbers are automatically casted.
If you mean to keep a leading zero in front of a number, you need to use a string.

#### What you have done

```puppet
$order = 010
```

#### What you should have done

```puppet
$order = '010'
```


#### Disabling the check

To disable this check, you can add `--no-leading_zero-check` to your puppet-lint command line.

```shell
$ puppet-lint --no-leading_zero-check path/to/file.pp
```

Alternatively, if youâ€™re calling puppet-lint via the Rake task, you should insert the following line to your `Rakefile`.

```ruby
PuppetLint.configuration.send('disable_leading_zero')
```
